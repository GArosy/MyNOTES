                <p>Louis Kahn (February 20, 1901 – March 17, 1974) is one of the most famous American architects in the
                    20th century. He is best known for his combination of modernism and the massiness and dignity of
                    ancient
                    relics. Although he didn't form a recognizable personal style until his early 50s and died at the
                    age of
                    73, in just two decades, Kang became a master of the pantheon of modernist architects, where great
                    architects such as Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe shine.</p>
                <p>Kahn may be classified as late modernism and belongs to one of them with great influence. During his
                    trip to Europe in 1928, he became more interested in medieval architecture, such as castles and
                    sieges. In his later life, his understanding of ancient architecture evolved into the depth and
                    stability of his own architecture, which echoed with Alvar Aalto's brick architecture and brutalist
                    in Corbusier's later works in many aspects. Speaking of Corbusier, he left his early mechanical
                    aesthetics after the 1950s. Kahn's most famous project is probably four freedoms Park in New York,
                    which was finally completed in 2012 after his death.</p>
                <p>His personal impression on the world is equally mysterious. His sometimes profound but always
                    profound understanding of architecture makes him often described as a "mystic" or "master". His
                    complicated private life inspired his son to shoot the documentary "my architect" for him in 2003,
                    which won an Oscar nomination. In the film, Philip Johnson, his contemporary, said, "Kahn is his own
                    artist. Compared with me, he is free."</p>
                <p>Kahn died in 1974. After returning to New York from a site visit to the Indian Institute of
                    management, Kahn had a heart attack in the men's toilet at the Pennsylvania Station. Although widely
                    praised, his studio was in deep debt at that time, and his family did not receive notice of his
                    death for two days due to poor communication between the police departments in New York and
                    Philadelphia. But Kahn's non ceremonial end of life brought luck in misfortune: he found a design of
                    Roosevelt Island in New York in memory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his briefcase. Nearly four
                    years later, these drawings contributed to Kahn's final project, <em>the four freedoms park</em>.</p>
